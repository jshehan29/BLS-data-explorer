# BLS Data Explorer

This repo contains files to create a flask app deployed on Heroku. The app currently allows the user to display plot for Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) over the last 10 years. Eventually, the app will incorporate time-series forecasting to forecast the CPI or PPI over some future window of time. The app will also incorporate more datasets to be explored.
